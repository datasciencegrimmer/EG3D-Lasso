# Syn-YawPi

This repository includes the official code to the paper (insert link). We provide our scripts for generating our synthetic Syn-YawPi database together with our best performing EG3D-Lasso pose quality predictors - pretrained on four different face recognition systems: ArcFace, MagFace, CurricularFace, and the commercial Cognitec tool.
